C_String is a C version of the C++ string. C strings are difficult to use and can be hard to understand for new programmers. C_String attempts to fix through dynamic allocation and easy to use functions.  Programmers don't need to worry about dynamic alloctions, NULL characters, or length issues. The functionality should be similar to the C++ strings.
